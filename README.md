# Minecraft Manhunt with Multiple Speedrunners

A Spigot plugin that permits users to have multiple speedrunners. Most (if not all) manhunt plugins out there support multiple hunters and not multiple speedrunners, so this plugin is designed to change that.

# How to Use
For information on command usage, please type "/manhunt help" with the plugin installed and running.

When the manhunt is initialized, right-click the compass to open an inventory containing the runner(s)' heads. Click one to track that player. Left-click to update your compass to track that player. You may also use the "/track" command as opposed to the inventory. As per usual, if the dragon dies, the runner(s) wins, and if the runner(s) dies, the hunter(s) win.

# Commands
/manhunt
/runner
/hunter
/track
